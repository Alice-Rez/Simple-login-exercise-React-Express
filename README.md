Just simple exercise from my web development course for connecting frontend (REact app) and backend (EXpress server). Sending login data to the server, checking, if they are correct (if there is user with the same set e-mail and pwd) and sending back message and user data.

**Disclaimer**: This is just simple exercise, the methods used for handling user data and especially passwords are not something to use in real life! Do not use it in real projects
